# nixOS-config
nixOS System configuration as flake, uses home-manager to manage more specific configs and other dotfiles.

System components:
|         |  main   |
|---------|---------|
|**shell**|  zsh    |
|**DM**   | gdm     |
| **DE**  | gnome   | 
|**WM**   | hyprland|
|**launcher**|rofi  |
|**notifs**| dunst  |
|**editor**| neovim |

Plans to switch fully from gdm/gnome $\rightarrow$ hyprland in the future. Need to sort bar + other essentials in the meantime.
